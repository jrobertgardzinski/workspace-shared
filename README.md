# The estate — a microservice portfolio, one clone away

> 👋 **Start here.** This is the map of my portfolio: a shared **identity kernel** and the social
> **meme portal** built on it — twenty-one independent repositories, six JVM flavours, every use case
> an **executable specification**. Two minutes well spent: the
> [security brochure](https://github.com/jrobertgardzinski/microservice-security) (with a video
> walkthrough), the [meme gallery](https://github.com/jrobertgardzinski/microservice-memes), and
> the blog at [jrobertgardzinski.pl](https://jrobertgardzinski.pl/).

**What is on show**

- **DDD + hexagonal architecture** with the dependency rule enforced: domain → config → system →
  application → infrastructure, and the same Gherkin scenarios driven from more than one door.
- **Executable specs** over real HTTP in every build: 18 in `microservice-security` (register,
  authenticate, sessions, MFA and passkeys, OAuth, roles, live password policy, account deletion),
  7 in `microservice-memes` (upload, vote, tag, delete, flag, purge policy, erasure).
- **Six flavours of the JVM**, one estate: Micronaut (security), Quarkus (email), Spring Boot
  (memes, comments), Helidon SE on virtual threads (user-collections), Javalin (paddock), plus
  Python stdlib stubs (IdP, image encoder, SMS, push).
- **Distributed patterns done for real**: a transactional outbox on Kafka, the account-deletion
  saga extracted into its own process manager (orchestration with compensation) next to a
  choreographed cascade, offline JWT/JWKS verification shared by every consumer, Pact contracts
  verified on the provider's CI, a configuration ladder (a database row over a property over the
  code default, with fail-fast and fall-through laws).
- **Proof, not prose**: generated C4 diagrams from the compose file and the pacts, Allure-generated
  documentation of the lower layers, a smoke test that walks the whole stack end to end.

## The workspace

Each sub-directory is an **independent git repository** with its own history and remote; this
repo only ties them together for convenience:

- an **aggregating `pom.xml`** so the whole thing builds as one Maven reactor and
  imports as a single project in the IDE, and
- **shared scripts and tooling** used across the projects (Allure aggregation,
  documentation generation, cheatsheets).

The sub-repositories are gitignored here — this workspace does **not** version
their contents.

**A kernel and a product:** the **shared kernel** (identity, mail chain, stub IdP, notification
channels, every shared library) lives here; the social **PORTAL** (memes gallery, comments,
favourites, the paddock hub) lives in the sibling workspace
[`workspace-portal`](https://github.com/jrobertgardzinski/workspace-portal) and consumes the
kernel through `~/.m2` and the identity compose file. The generated
[C4 diagrams](docs/c4-architecture.md) draw that boundary and the generator enforces it.

## Getting started on a fresh machine

The estate is sibling workspaces holding independent git repositories between them. One script
clones and keeps all of them; its map is data in [`estate/`](estate/) (one `<directory> <url>`
line per repository). Everything the portfolio shows is public; a few repositories in the map are
private and are simply reported as failed unless the GitHub CLI is signed in.

```bash
# prerequisites: git, JDK 25, Docker with compose, Node 20+ (the React UIs), Python 3 (the stubs)
mkdir -p ~/Documents/git && cd ~/Documents/git
git clone https://github.com/jrobertgardzinski/workspace-shared.git shared
./shared/estate.sh clone          # clones every workspace and sub-repository that is missing
cd shared && ./mvnw install       # the kernel first; the products consume it from ~/.m2
```

Day to day:

```bash
./estate.sh status [--fetch]      # one line per repository: branch, ahead/behind, dirty files
./estate.sh pull                  # fast-forward every clean repository; dirty ones are listed, not touched
./estate.sh check                 # the map must match the territory: manifests vs disk vs .gitignore
```

Adding a repository: create it on GitHub, clone it into the right workspace, add its line to the
workspace's `.gitignore` and to `estate/<workspace>.repos`; `./estate.sh check` tells you if you
forgot one of the two.

## Projects

Build order is computed automatically by the Maven reactor; the natural
dependency order is:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `test-starter` | Shared JUnit5 / BDD / system test starters |
| `libs` | Constraint / validation primitives (artifact `constraint`) |
| `config` | The configuration ladder: `ConfigValue`, `Configuration.liveOver/boundOver`, the settings snapshot |
| `email` | Email value objects (`email-domain`, `-config`, `-usecase`) |
| `password` | Password value objects and policy (`password-domain`, `-config`, `-usecase`), hash algorithms (Argon2) |
| `adjustable-clock` / `infrastructure-micronaut-clock` | Steerable test clock + its Micronaut adapter |
| `voting` | Voting bounded context as a library (toggle + tally over the Ballots port) |
| `offline-jwt` | Offline verification of security's tokens (JWKS + EdDSA), shared by the consumer services |
| `microservice-security` | The shared identity: hexagonal on Micronaut (16 executable specs: register, authenticate, sessions, MFA/passkeys, OAuth, deletion saga, …) |
| `microservice-email` | Mail microservice, BCE on Quarkus (`POST /mails*`, Qute templates) |
| `microservice-memes` | Meme microservice, layered modules on Spring Boot (upload/thumbnails/votes, gallery UI) |
| `microservice-comments` | Comment threads + comment votes; Spring Boot with its own Postgres |
| `microservice-paddock` | The portal's social hub (servers, people, events; PWA), vertical slices on Javalin |
| `microservice-user-collections` | A user's saved refs (favourites), Helidon 4 SE on virtual threads |
| `microservice-offboarding` | The portal's account-deletion process manager (the saga orchestration, extracted from security); participants are configuration |

**Not in the reactor:** the Python helper services (`microservice-idp`, `-image`, `-sms`,
`-push`) are not Maven modules.

## Build

The aggregator is a **pure aggregator**, not the parent of the modules — every
sub-project keeps its own parent and stays buildable standalone.

```bash
# The whole kernel reactor, correct order, one command:
./mvnw clean install

# A single project standalone:
cd microservice-security && ./mvnw clean verify
```

Requires JDK 25. The Maven Wrapper (`./mvnw`, Maven 3.9.9) is committed, so no
system Maven is needed.

## Run the whole stack

`docker-compose.yml` starts the portal and its infrastructure: the portal
services (security + email + memes + comments + paddock + user-collections, each
stateful one with its own Postgres), **Kafka** as the portal's event backbone
(mail requests from security's transactional outbox, the account-deletion saga,
the `MEME_DELETED` cascade), MinIO for the gallery's image bytes,
[Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) as the dev inbox, the stub OIDC provider,
and the observability stack
(Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Tempo). The **gallery UI** lives at
http://localhost:8083/ (browsing is public; sign-up/sign-in goes through
security; signed-in users upload, vote and star favourites).

```bash
./infra-up.sh      # package the jars, build the images, start the SYSTEM
./infra-up.sh --observability   # ...plus the monitoring context (a compose profile) and the OTel agent
./infra-smoke.sh   # end-to-end proof: register -> mail -> verify -> sign-in,
                   # meme upload, deletion saga, favourites CORS
./infra-down.sh    # stop (add -v to drop the database volumes)
```

Ports: security 8080, email 8082, memes 8083 (gallery UI), comments 8085, paddock 8086, user-collections 8092, collections-ui 8093,
offboarding 8094, Mailpit UI 8025, Grafana 3000. The internal wiring is published
too (security's Postgres 5433, Kafka's host listener 29092, Mailpit SMTP 1025,
sms 8088, push 8089) so that ONE service can run from the IDE against the rest:
`./dev-swap.sh security` stops the container and prints the env from
`dev/local/security.env` to paste into the Run Configuration; `./dev-swap.sh back
security` brings the container back. Same script for the portal services from
`../portal` (their env files live there). The full map lives in
[docs/onboarding-guide.md](docs/onboarding-guide.md) and the generated
[C4 diagrams](docs/c4-architecture.md).
