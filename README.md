# security

Workspace for the security projects. Each sub-directory is an **independent git
repository** with its own history and remote; this repo only ties them together
for convenience:

- an **aggregating `pom.xml`** so the whole thing builds as one Maven reactor and
  imports as a single project in the IDE, and
- **shared scripts and tooling** used across the projects (Allure aggregation,
  documentation generation, cheatsheets).

The sub-repositories are gitignored here — this workspace does **not** version
their contents.

**Two products, not one:** the social **PORTAL** (memes gallery, comments,
favourites, the paddock hub) and the **F1 GAME** (`formula-simulator` + its
Python `race-sim`) are separate beings that share only **identity**
(`microservice-security` — one account, one token works in both). The generated
[C4 diagrams](docs/c4-architecture.md) draw that boundary and the generator
enforces it.

## Projects

Build order is computed automatically by the Maven reactor; the natural
dependency order is:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `test-starter` | Shared JUnit5 / BDD / system test starters |
| `constraint` | Constraint / validation primitives |
| `config` | Configuration primitives (`PropertiesConfigPort`/`Source`) |
| `email` | Email value objects + email-security |
| `password` | Password value objects, hash algorithms (Argon2), password-security |
| `adjustable-clock` / `infrastructure-micronaut-clock` | Steerable test clock + its Micronaut adapter |
| `voting` | Voting bounded context as a library (toggle + tally over the Ballots port) |
| `offline-jwt` | Offline verification of security's tokens (JWKS + EdDSA), shared by the consumer services |
| `microservice-security` | The shared identity: hexagonal on Micronaut (16 executable specs: register, authenticate, sessions, MFA/passkeys, OAuth, deletion saga, …) |
| `microservice-email` | Mail microservice, BCE on Quarkus (`POST /mails*`, Qute templates) |
| `microservice-memes` | Meme microservice, layered modules on Spring Boot (upload/thumbnails/votes, gallery UI) |
| `microservice-comments` | Comment threads + comment votes; Spring Boot with its own Postgres |
| `microservice-paddock` | The portal's social hub (servers, people, events; PWA), vertical slices on Javalin |
| `microservice-user-collections` | A user's saved refs (favourites), Helidon 4 SE on virtual threads |
| `microservice-offboarding` | The portal's account-deletion process manager (the saga orchestration, extracted from security); participants are configuration |

**Not in the reactor:** `formula-simulator` — the F1 game is a **separate
product** and builds standalone (`./mvnw -f formula-simulator/pom.xml clean verify`,
after a one-time `./mvnw -pl offline-jwt -am install`). The Python helper services
(`microservice-idp`, `-image`, `-sms`, `-push`, `race-sim`) are not Maven modules.

## Build

The aggregator is a **pure aggregator**, not the parent of the modules — every
sub-project keeps its own parent and stays buildable standalone.

```bash
# The whole PORTAL reactor, correct order, one command:
./mvnw clean install

# The F1 game (separate product):
./mvnw -f formula-simulator/pom.xml clean verify

# A single project standalone:
cd microservice-security && ./mvnw clean verify
```

Requires JDK 25. The Maven Wrapper (`./mvnw`, Maven 3.9.9) is committed, so no
system Maven is needed.

## Run the whole stack

`docker-compose.yml` starts both products and their infrastructure: the portal
services (security + email + memes + comments + paddock + user-collections, each
stateful one with its own Postgres), **Kafka** as the portal's event backbone
(mail requests from security's transactional outbox, the account-deletion saga,
the `MEME_DELETED` cascade), MinIO for the gallery's image bytes,
[Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) as the dev inbox, the stub OIDC provider,
the F1 game with its sealed `race-sim`, and the observability stack
(Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Tempo). The **gallery UI** lives at
http://localhost:8083/ (browsing is public; sign-up/sign-in goes through
security; signed-in users upload, vote and star favourites).

```bash
./infra-up.sh      # package the jars, build the images, start everything
./infra-smoke.sh   # end-to-end proof: register -> mail -> verify -> sign-in,
                   # meme upload, deletion saga, favourites CORS
./infra-down.sh    # stop (add -v to drop the database volumes)
```

Ports: security 8080, email 8082, memes 8083 (gallery UI), formula 8084 (race
viewer), comments 8085, paddock 8086, user-collections 8092, collections-ui 8093,
offboarding 8094, Mailpit UI 8025, Grafana 3000. The full map lives in
[docs/przewodnik-juniora.md](docs/przewodnik-juniora.md) and the generated
[C4 diagrams](docs/c4-architecture.md).
